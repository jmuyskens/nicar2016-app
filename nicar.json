If you can use an Internet browser, you can create award-winning maps.\nPrerequisites: None. This class is for anyone who wants to create online maps, whether they’re a seasoned pro or a complete novice. You’ll walk away with the knowledge you need to go back to your newsroom and start making maps immediately."}, {"day": "2", "start_time": "2016-03-11T14:15:00", "end_time": "2016-03-11T15:15:00", "category": "Panel", "title": "Election: Dark money", "speaker": "Carrie Levine, Robert Maguire, T.
